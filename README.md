# Accordian-Simple-Way ( https://simplifiedweb.github.io/Accordian-Simple-Way/)
This is the Simple explanation How I developed an Accordian.
- So the layout I'm talking here was like a big box have 4 small boxes and in each box we have two boxes. which is one the answer section and the question section.
- so basically the main container for wrapping everything and the each 4 boxes is for postioning, than inside each box we use the sections.
- so basically the logic here is was that htmlcollections in DOM is used for iterating each elements by Index numbers so when we target the accordian that is a main container,
 that it has the 4 childrens that is a index number we are taking about.
 so whenever we click the boxes we are targetting the index numbers and adding the class "active" and increasing the height and adding transitions.
